# Sleep Manager
This project was made with an objective of benefiting me when I had the most trashy sleep schedule. 

## Features: 
1. Sleep Cycle Calculator (You can input how much sleep you had for the previous night and rate it aswell)
3. Sleep Progress Tracker
4. Data analytics :  Graph for hours of sleep over date (also user rating for that sleep cycle, and also determines wheater that sleep is good, bad or okay) 
5. Smart alerts and browser notifications

## Notice:
This project is a bit old (I made it for my IB PCUP a year ago), so im not very sure about how well the functions are working, but I am sure the Sleep Cycle Calcualtor, Sleep Progress Tracker and the alert with notification system work. There might be a little problem with the analytis page.

PCUP documentation for the project (if u want to see the process of developing this)(It recieved a 6/7 against my better judgement :((( ):
