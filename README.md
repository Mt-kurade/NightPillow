#Sleep Manager 

This project was made with an objective of benefiting 

Features: 
1. Sleep Cycle Calculator
2. Sleep Progress Tracker
3. Data analytics
4. Smart alerts and browser notifications

Notice:
This project is a bit old (I made it for my IB PCUP a year ago), so im not very sure about how well the functions are working, but I am sure the Sleep Cycle Calcualtor, Sleep Progress Tracker and the alert with notification system work. There might be a little problem with the analytis page.

PCUP documentation for the project (if u want to see the process of developing this)(It recieved a 6/7 against my better judgement :((( ):
